## Project Loom is an ongoing project in the Java ecosystem that aims to simplify concurrency and improve the scalability and performance of Java applications. Concurrency in Java is typically managed using threads, which can be heavyweight and expensive to create and manage. Project Loom introduces the concept of "fibers," which are lightweight, user-mode threads designed to make concurrency in Java more efficient and easier to work with.
